# coursera-html-css-indepth\
This is the portfoloio project for my final assessment of the Coursera HTML and CSS In Depth course.\
I enjoyed this build and troubleshooting spacing issues a learning experience. \
I was required to create interactivity through the use of effects and pseudoclasses, and enjoyed figuring \
out how to flip the logo and blur the tiles. I didn't do everything I wanted to but overall\
was happy with the way this project came out. \
I chose to use the ficitonal Lucky Shrub landscaping and nursery business option and went with a \
desert theme as it is based in Tucson, AZ. \
It was fun!
